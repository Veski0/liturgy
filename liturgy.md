# The Divine Liturgy

**Priest**
*makes three low bows before the Altar, praying quietly:*
O heavenly King, O Comforter, the Spirit of truth, who art in all places and fillest all things; Treasury of good things and Giver of life:
Come and dwell in us and cleanse us from every stain, and save our souls, O gracious Lord.
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, and good will among men (twice).
O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise.
